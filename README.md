# WKB Disc
This code implments the underlying equation behind the WKB disc approximation (e.g. Binney and Tremaine for information). The main two calculation files are:

- `WKB_Disc.py`: This calculates all the important information about the disc and uses the density profile to estimate the frequency of cavity modes.

The other files, use the methods in WKB_DISC to generate different plots.
